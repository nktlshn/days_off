1) create credentials.json using this documentation https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials

you should create OAuth client ID credentials to authenticate under your google account in a project

2) use quickstart.py from https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python

run it with created credentials.json to access google sheet (notice that file token.json is created, with first run of
the script)
